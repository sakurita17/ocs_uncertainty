# ocs_uncertainty

he key point here is that when we pass EBV to OCS we pretend that we know EBV with full certainty, but in fact, we donâ€™t, not unless we have very high reliability in these EBV (=lots of data per each individual or huge numbers of their progeny- think AI bulls). So, the aim of this internship is to take this into account this uncertainty when we do OCS. I will let you play with the plots and then you can go to the next step of running OCS for every sample you have generated (you have 1000 samples, so you will run 1000 optiSel runs!). You know how to use for loops, do you?
